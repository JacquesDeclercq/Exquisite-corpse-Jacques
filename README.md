# Exquisite-corpse-Jacques


The Jolly old story of Jacques
Jacques was a famous story teller
But never a good code teller

But one day Jacques attended to
a BeCode conference and his life
changed forever... Now he can code!!!

Also, Jacques is enjoying giving a techtalk
on AI topics to his fellows coders. And he
is pretty good at it !!!

As he is a real PhotoShop Master, the 
presentation looks exquisite. Lots of shiny things, 
lots of nice colors. I like! 

Jacques had a change of heart.
Since he is all about open source software, he ditched photoshop
and started working with *Krita*
