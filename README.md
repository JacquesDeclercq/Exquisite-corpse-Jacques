# Exquisite-corpse-Jacques


The Jolly old story of Jacques
Jacques was a famous story teller
But never a good code teller

But one day Jacques attended to
a BeCode conference and his life
changed forever... Now he can code!!!

Also, Jacques is enjoying giving a techtalk
on AI topics to his fellows coders. And he
is pretty good at it !!!

As he is a real PhotoShop Master, the 
presentation looks exquisite. Lots of shiny things, 
lots of nice colors. I like! 


I am tall but not so tall.
I am big but not so big.
I am smart but, but no but.

AS he is a nice storyteller! people will be enjoy his story very curiously!
his AI topic will be very good helpful for his fellow coders and coders will use it.

Okay, he seems nice, I'll give him that. But the last contributors were kissing his ass a lot. As if he's the best in the world. He's not Superman, is he now?? Can he fly?? I don't think so. So cut if off! O_o
